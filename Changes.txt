We have successfully implemented all the features mentioned in the design doc with some relevant improvements. In the doc we mentioned a feature to search a complaint by its name, instead of doing this we modified it into a better feature. We have given filtering option to the users which enables them to filter out the resolved complaints, unresolved complaints and the ones in which he is the action user.
